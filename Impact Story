Hi! I am Manuel Mondido Jr., who graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Information 
Technology. from Quezon City, Philippines. I find Virtualahan in my
friend who has a friend also alumni of virtualahan. his friend referred
me to virtualahan. I am very thankful because I had a chance to join  
virtualahan. After all, the class on every team is very limited. the learnings
I learned here in virtualahan is very helpful, which can help me in my
onboarding in virtual jobs. I didn't expect this kind of opportunity
will be given to me. and also am thankful to all couches who didn't get tired
to teach us and being patient with us. they make sure all of their
students are following and answering every student's questions and concerns.
